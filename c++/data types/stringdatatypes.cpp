// string data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in the most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string greeting = "hello";

    cout << greeting;

    return 0;
}
